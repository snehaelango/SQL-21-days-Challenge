## 🔹 Day 1: SQL Coding Challenge – Hospital Database

On Day 1, I focused on practicing fundamental SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) operations by designing and modifying a hospital database table.

### 📌 Tasks Completed

- Created a table named `Patients`.
- Added a new column `DoctorAssigned` with data type `VARCHAR(50)`.
- Modified the `PatientName` column to allow up to 100 characters.
- Renamed the table from `Patients` to `Patient_Info`.
- Understood the difference between:
  - **TRUNCATE** – Removes all records but keeps the table structure.
  - **DROP** – Deletes the table completely along with its structure.

### 🎯 Concepts Practiced

- Table creation  
- Altering table structure  
- Adding and modifying columns  
- Renaming tables  
- Difference between TRUNCATE and DROP
